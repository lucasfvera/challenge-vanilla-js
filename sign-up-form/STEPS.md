- [x] build the form structure: form, labels, inputs, button
- [ ] connect the sign up form, or use the default behavior (POST)
  - maybe add a handler
- [x] create the validations: email and password
  - validate on change
  - avoid validating until the user touched the field (on blur)
- show error messages under the fields
- basic CSS styles
- UX improvements
  - descriptions with requirements under input fields
  - error messages on submit
  - email/username live check on availability


Nice to haves
- validate on change and on blur
- show hide password feature
- form state submission
