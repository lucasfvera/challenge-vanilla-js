# React + Vanilla JS Exercises


## 🧪 3 Practical Exercises You Should Try

### 1. **Build a To-Do List App (Vanilla JS + React variant)**

**Concepts Practiced**: List rendering, input management, DOM interaction, form handling, validation, filtering

* Add, remove, edit to-dos
* Filter (e.g. "Show completed", "Search")
* Validate empty input
* Bonus: Add keyboard accessibility or style different states

👉 Practice both in **plain JS** (querySelector, createElement, etc.) and in **React** (state, controlled inputs, list rendering).

### 2. **Create a Live Search Filter**

**Concepts Practiced**: State management, re-rendering, filtering, case sensitivity

* Render a list of items (e.g., users, cities)
* Add a search input that filters the list based on user input
* Make it **case-insensitive**
* Bonus: Add a loading spinner when filtering a large list (simulate async)

---

### 3. **Form with Real-Time Validation**

**Concepts Practiced**: DOM interaction, form handling, validation, component lifecycle

* Build a form with 3+ fields (email, password, confirm password)
* Add validation: required, email format, match password
* Show errors in real-time as the user types
* Bonus: Disable submit unless the form is valid
